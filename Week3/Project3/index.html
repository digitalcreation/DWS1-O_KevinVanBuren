        <div id="title"><h1>Hiking</h1></div>

        <div id="intro"><p>Hiking in <em>Canada</em> and the <em>USA</em> is the preferred term for a long, vigorous walk, usually on
           trails, in the countryside, while the word walking is used for shorter, particularly urban walks. On the
           other hand in the <em>United Kingdom</em>, and the <em>Republic of Ireland</em>, the term walking is used
           to describe all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in the park or trekking in the Alps. The word
           hiking is also sometimes used in the <abbr title="United Kingdom"><strong>UK</strong></abbr>, along with
           rambling, hillwalking, and fell walking. In <em>New Zealand</em> a long, vigorous walk or hike is called
           tramping. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that
           all forms of walking have health benefits.</p></div>

        <div id="overview"><h2 id="history-overview"> History - Overview </h2>

                <p>The idea of undertaking a walk through the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th-century, and
                arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature, associated with the Romantic movement.
                In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy.</p>

        <div class="column1"><h3 id="history-uk"> History in the United Kingdom </h3>

        <p>Thomas West, an English clergyman, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake
           District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed to encourage the taste of visiting the
           lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and
           laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made
           the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.</p>

        <p>To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be
           encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book
           was a major success.</p>

        <p>Map of Robert Louis Stevenson's walking route, taken from Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes(1879), a
           pioneering classic of outdoor literature.
           Another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure, was the English poet William Wordsworth. In 1790
           he embarked on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, a journey subsequently recorded in
           his long autobiographical poem The Prelude (1850). His famous poem Tintern Abbey was inspired by a visit
           to the Wye Valley made during a walking tour of Wales in 1798 with his sister Dorothy Wordsworth.
           Wordsworth's friend Coleridge was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth
           undertook a three weeks tour of the Lake District. John Keats, who belonged to the next generation of
           Romantic poets began, in June 1818, a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the Lake District with his
           friend Charles Armitage Brown.</p>

        <p>More and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th-century, of which the most famous is
           probably Robert Louis Stevenson's journey through the Cévennes in France with a donkey, recorded in his
           Travels with a Donkey (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay "Walking Tours". The
           sub-genre of travel writing produced many classics in the subsequent 20th-century. An early American
           example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist John Muir's A Thousand Mile Walk
           to the Gulf (1916), a posthumous published account of a long botanizing walk, undertaken in 1867.</p>

        <p>Commemorative plaque of the Mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932; an event that led to great expansion
           of the public right of access to the British countryside.
           Due to industrialisation in England, people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were
           often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the
           countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of Manchester and
           Sheffield, was privately owned and trespass was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the north
           and began politically campaigning for the legal 'right to roam'. One of the first such clubs, was
           'Sunday Tramps' founded by Leslie White in 1879. The first national grouping, the Federation of
           Rambling Clubs, was formed in London in 1905 and was heavily patronized by the peerage.</p>

        <p>Access to Mountains bills, that would have legislated the public's 'right to roam' across some private
           land, were periodically presented to Parliament from 1884 to 1932 without success. Finally, in 1932,
           the Rambler’s Right Movement organized a mass trespass on Kinder Scout in Derbyshire. Despite attempts
           on the part of the police to prevent the trespass from going ahead it was successfully achieved due to
           massive publicity. However the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers,
           including the organization The Ramblers, who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and
           it was eventually repealed.</p>

        <p>The effort to improve access led after World War II to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside
           Act 1949, and in 1951 to the creation of the first national park in the UK, the Peak District National
           Park. The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors
           enthusiasts. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 considerably extended the right to roam in
           England and Wales.</p></div>

        <div class="column2"><h3 id="history-us"> History in the United States </h3>

        <p>An early example of an interest in hiking in the United States, is Abel Crawford and his son Ethan's
           clearing of a trail to the summit of Mount Washington, New Hampshire in 1819. This 8.5 mile path is the
           oldest continually used hiking trail in the United States. The influence of British and European Romanticism
           reached North America through the transcendentalist movement, and both Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82) and
           Henry David Thoreau (1817-62) were important influences on the outdoors movement in North America. Thoreau's
           writing on nature and on walking include the posthumously published "Walking" (1862). While an earlier essay
           "A Walk to Wachusett" (1842) describes a four day walking tour he took with a companion from Concord,
           Massachusetts to the summit of Mount Wachusett, Princeton, Massachusetts and back. In 1876 the Appalachian
           Mountain Club, America’s oldest recreation organization, was founded to protect the trails and mountains in
           the northeastern United States.</p>

        <p>The Scottish-born, American naturalist John Muir (1838-1914), was another important early advocate of
           the preservation of wilderness in the United States. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for the National Park
           bill that was passed in 1890, establishing Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks. The Sierra Club, which he
           founded, is now one of the most important conservation organizations in the United States. The spiritual
           quality and enthusiasm toward nature expressed in his writings inspired readers, including presidents and
           congressmen, to take action to help preserve large areas of undeveloped countryside. He is today
           referred to as the "Father of the National Parks". In 1916, the National Park Service was created to
           protect national parks and monuments.</p>

        <p>In the 1921 Benton MacKaye, a forester, conceived the idea of the America's first National trail, the
           Appalachian trail, and this was completed in August 1937, running from Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine to
           Georgia. The Pacific Crest Trail ("PCT") was first explored in the 1930s by the YMCA hiking groups and
           was eventually registered as a complete border to border trail from Mexico to Canada.</p></div>

        <div class="column1" id="impact"><h2 id="environment"> Environmental Impact </h2>

        <p>Parts of many hiking trails around Lake Mohonk include stairways which can prevent erosion
           Hikers often seek beautiful natural environments in which to hike. These environments are often fragile,
           as hikers may accidentally destroy the environment that they enjoy. While the action of an individual
           may not strongly affect the environment, the mass effect of a large number of hikers can degrade the
           environment. For example, gathering wood in an alpine area to start a fire may be harmless if done once
           (except for wildfire risk). Years of gathering wood, however, can strip an alpine area of valuable
           nutrients. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the
           environment. If hikers follow such regulations, their impact can be minimized. Such regulations include
           forbidding wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal
           matter, imposing a quota on the number of hikers per mile.</p>

        <p>Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace: hiking in a way such that future hikers cannot
           detect the presence of previous hikers. Practitioners of this philosophy obey its strictures, even in
           the absence of area regulations. Followers of this practice follow strict practices on dealing with
           food waste, food packaging, and alterations to the surrounding environment.</p>

        <p>A cathole for human waste
           Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking. These wastes can contaminate
           the watershed and make other hikers ill. Bacterial contamination can be avoided by digging 'catholes'
           10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covering after use. If these
           catholes are dug at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, the risk of contamination
           is minimized.</p>

        <p>Sometimes hikers enjoy viewing rare or endangered species. However, some species (such as martens or
           bighorn sheep) are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. To prevent
           adverse impact, hikers should learn the habits and habitats of endangered species.</p>

        <p>There is one situation where an individual hiker can make a large impact on an ecosystem:
           inadvertently starting a wildfire. For example, in 2005, a Czech backpacker burned 7% of Torres del
           Paine National Park in Chile by knocking over an illegal gas portable stove. Obeying area
           regulations and setting up cooking devices on designated areas (or if necessary on bare ground) will
           reduce the risk of wildfire.</p></div>

        <div class="column2"><h2 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h2>

        <p>Hiking in a group like this increases safety, but hikers may wish to hike at different rates.
           Sometimes hikers can interfere with each other's enjoyment, or that of other users of the land. Hiking
           etiquette has developed to minimize such interference. Common hiking etiquette includes:</p>

        <p>When two groups of hikers meet on a steep trail, a custom has developed in some areas whereby the group
           moving uphill has the right-of-way.</p>

        <p>Being forced to hike much faster than one's natural pace can be annoying, difficult to maintain
           consistently, and increases fatigue; it may also cause injury. But if a group splits between fast and slow
           hikers, the slow hikers may be left behind or become lost. Therefore a common custom is to encourage the
           slowest hiker to lead and have everyone match that speed. Another custom is to have experienced hiker(s)
           sweep up the rear on a rota, to ensure that everyone in the group is safe.</p>

        <p>Hikers generally avoid making loud sounds, such as shouting or loud conversation, or the use of
           mobile phones. However, in bear country, hikers make noise as a safety precaution.</p>

        <p>Hikers tend to avoid impacting on the land through which they travel. Hikers can avoid impact by
           staying on established trails, not picking plants, or disturbing wildlife, and carrying garbage out.
           The Leave No Trace movement offers a set of guidelines for low-impact hiking: "Leave nothing but
           footprints. Take nothing but photos. Kill nothing but time. Keep nothing but memories".</p>

        <p>The feeding of wild animals is dangerous and can cause harm to both the animals and to other people.</p></div>



        <h2 id="hazards">Hazards</h2>

        <p>Hiking may produce threats to personal safety. These threats can be dangerous circumstances and/or
           specific accidents or ailments. Diarrhea, for example, has been found to be one of the most common
           illnesses afflicting long-distance hikers in the United States. (See Wilderness acquired diarrhea.)</p>

        <p>Noxious plants that cause rashes can also be particularly bothersome. Such plants include poison oak,
           poison ivy, poison sumac, and stinging nettles. Other dangers include becoming lost, inclement weather,
           hazardous terrain, or exacerbation of pre-existing medical conditions. Additional potential hazards are
           dehydration, hypothermia, frostbite, sunburn, sunstroke. attacks by animals, including snakes, or injuries
           such as ankle sprain, or broken bones. Attacks by humans are also a reality in some places, and
           lightning is also a threat, especially on high ground.</p>

        <p>The crossing of glaciers is potentially hazardous because of the potential for crevasses.
           These giant cracks in the ice are not always visible as snow can be blown and freeze over the top to
           make a snowbridge. To cross a glacier the use of a rope, crampons and ice axes are usually required.</p>

        <p>Deep, fast flowing rivers pose another danger and a rope can be helpful when attempting a crossing.</p>

        <p>In various countries, borders may be poorly marked, so it is good practice to know where international
           borders are. In 2009, Iran imprisoned three Americans for hiking across the Iran-Iraq border. It is
           illegal to cross into the USA on the Pacific Crest Trail from Canada. Going south to north it is more
           straightforward and a crossing can be made, if advanced arrangements are made with Canadian Border
           Services. Within the European Union, and associated nations like Switzerland and Norway, there are no
           impediments to crossing by path, and borders are not always obvious. All the same necessary
           documents should always be carried and the law followed (people from some countries may require a visa).</p>
